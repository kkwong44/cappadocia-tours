        <h2 id="discover-cappadocia">Discover Cappadocia by travel itineraries created by local guides</h2>
        <p id="about-discovery">Travel to Turkey and break away from the bustle of the big cities to experience the
            rural culture of the
            Cappadocia region. A series of volcanic eruptions resulted in the area being swamped in ash, which then
            hardened to form a porous rock. The elements carved the terrain into the odd fairy chimneys, and later the
            inhabitants discovered they too could carve the rocks into homes and churches. A base in Goreme allows you
            to easily explore Cappadocia with a local guide, so come and discover Cappadocia's many mysteries and
            legends.</p>
