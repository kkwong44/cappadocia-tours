        <p id="about-discovery">Travel to Turkey and break away from the bustle of the big cities to experience the
            rural culture of the Cappadocia region. A series of volcanic eruptions resulted in the area being swamped in
            ash, which then hardened to form a porous rock. The elements carved the terrain into the odd fairy chimneys,
            and later the inhabitants discovered they too could carve the rocks into homes and churches. A base in
            Goreme allows you to easily explore Cappadocia with a local guide, so come and discover Cappadocia's many
            mysteries and legends.</p>
