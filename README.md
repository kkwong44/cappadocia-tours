    * Payment and tour confirmation will be sent out after the reservation has been carried out successfully

## Functional Testing
During the development phase, each feature was tested and ensured that the fundamental functions have achieved before going on to develop the next feature.

Once the site has been created, a full user acceptance testing was carried out to eliminate any bugs, errors or missing functionality. For example,
during the responsive tests, it was identified that the navigation menu was not functioning correctly for all pages. This was caused by the feature was developed on the home page but forgot to implement it to other pages. The tests then repeated until all issues are resolved.

This user acceptance testing was designed with all possible tests to simulate the user actions and the same tests are repeated on the live site to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.

There are 2 main test groups.
* Functional testing on each page
* Responsive testing on multiple devices

### User Acceptance Testing Report

The following report shows the final tests result that have been carried out.

![Test Report Page 9](readme/test-reports/test-report-page9.png)

## Validator Testing
Validator testing is used to validate codes that are legally written and to identify any possible errors. This can be done by using online automated testing tools to scan through the codes.
The tools used for this project are
* W3C Markup Validation Service to validate HTML - https://validator.w3.org/
* W3C CSS Validation Service to validate CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

The code can be copied and paste directly into the validator to perform the test. A report will be generated with the test results where it identified the errors. The validator will show passed when the code is free of error.

Although the site seems to be functioning correctly but during the initial validation test, it was identified that one of the ID name in the HTML was not unique and used in several places. This was rectified then the process repeated and passed the test.

### Validation Reports
The following reports show all HTML pages and CSS code have passed the test.

*Home Page - index.html*

![HTML Validation on Home Page](readme/test-reports/validation-html-index.png)

*Gallery Page - gallery.html*

*Stylesheet - style.css*

## Performance and Accessibility Testing
Lighthouse is a tool in Chrome Development Tools that allows developer to test their website. Performance and Accessibility are two of the tests carried out by Lighthouse and it can identify where you can improve the performance and accessibility.

The performance testing was carried out on the site and shows each page can be improved on the images that were used. There were several attempts to improve the performance by reducing dimensions, file sizes and file formats. The test cycle was repeated on each attempt and the final version was to use the minimum dimensions on each image, convert into Webp from Jpg format and optimize the file size by using image optimiser tool.

All images are optimised, uploaded and use in the live site.

From the lighthouse reports at below, it shows the site perform well. The site was physically tested on several devices from desktops, tablets and mobile phones. The performance on these devices were operated normally and without lagging.

*Lighthouse Report on confirmation.html*

![Performance Report Confirmation Page](readme/test-reports/performance-report-confirmation.png)

## Unfixed Bugs
Currently, the reservation page is not fully developed. There is no backend to support the site and the submission of the form is only simulated by returning a Reservation Received message.

The validation and implementation to the backend is out of this project scope but it can be developed in future to become a fully operational website.

## Deployment
### Tools
* GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration
* Gitpod is a ready-to-code developer environment

### Development processes

* All the development works are carried out in Gitpod
* Create a repository in Github through Gitpod
* Start the project from a boilerplate written by Code Institue. The full template can be copied from [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

    **Repeat the following until project completion**

* Developing your site, save your project in your Gitpod workspaces
* Use git add command to add files to local repository
* Use git commit command to commit the changes to local repository

### Deployment to Github Pages

* Use git push to upload local repository content (Gitpod) to a remote repository (Github)

    **The published site link can be found from your Github repository setting.**

* Select setting from your github repository
* Select Pages on the left hand side menu as shown below
* Under the Source section, you need to select main from Branch in order to publish the site
* You can suspend the published site by selecting none from Branch in the source section

In order to commit any new changes to the live site, always perform git push to upload the latest version of the development code to the remote repository.

## Credits
### Content
The content of the website is an adaptation of the Love Running project. Initially the HTML was based on the Love Running project but found the code become cumbersome as the development progress. Then I have decided to use flexbox feature to rewrite some of the sections like the footer and the reservation form.

The information and description of Cappadocia tours are from the following websites:

* interpid - [https://www.intrepidtravel.com](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/) 
* Viator - [https://www.viator.com/](https://www.viator.com/)

The footer icons for the Social Media are from:

* Font Awesome website - [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)

Website favicon was generated from:

* favicon - [https://favicon.io/](https://favicon.io/)

The image zoom technique is based on the example from:

* W3schools - [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp)

The flexbox techniques are based on the following youtube videos and websites

* Flexbox challenge - [https://flexboxfroggy.com/](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
* Youtube by Thomas Bradley on flexbox columns - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2oSp_N-I7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2oSp_N-I7s)
* Youtube by LearnWebCode on Flexbox Tutorial - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc)

During this development phase I need a temporary solution to simulate a response from the system when a user submitted the form. The solution I found is from W3schools that allows to simulate this action. It is a simple 'onclick event' script to display text.

* W3schools onclick event - [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp)

### Media
The images used in this website are from the following:
